# I use in this project
- normalize
- separated css files
- font-face 

# Objectives for this project
- use flexbox and media queries for the layout and responsive design
- use 7-1 architecture for css files (without sass)


# Process
First I decide separate css into multiple files,
Then I will begin by adding the fonts.
I wll continue with creationg of the components (buttons,
then cards, then testimonials and signup)
Finally coding the layout.

Until now the development focus on components first
has been very satisfying. I can see my progress much better
than develop layout first

Ohter thing I learn is that always have a footer and a footer container
for the color change.

I also learn a little trick for always mantain the same margin, using: 
width: min(100% - margin, max-size);
