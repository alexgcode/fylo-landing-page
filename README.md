# I use in this project
- normalize
- Desktop-first workflow
- BEM

# Objectives for this project
- use flexbox and media queries for the layout and responsive design
- use 7-1 architecture for vanilla css files (not sass)


# Process
First I decide separate css into multiple files,
Then I will begin by adding the fonts.
I wll continue with creationg of the components (buttons,
then cards, then testimonials and signup)
Finally coding the layout.

Until now the development focus on components first
has been very satisfying. I can see my progress much better
than develop layout first

Ohter thing I learn is that always have a footer and a footer container
for the color change.

I also learn a little trick for always mantain the same margin, using: 
width: min(100% - margin, max-size); 

Also to change the color of an specific section of a svg image puting 
the fill property value to "currentcolor"

Finally learn how to validate email input inside a form with just html and css
using the property pattern of the input and the pseudoclass placeholder-shown of css


# Conclusion
- I liked use dev component first focus, I will used from now on.
- Spliting css into multiple files liked too, make it easier and faster to make changes
and rehuse components for other projects.
